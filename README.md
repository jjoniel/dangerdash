# Danger Dash 
An *interactive game* designed to simulate emergency scenarios using GenAI. Primarily aimed at kids but also engaging for adults, the game creates unique emergency situations where players must make *critical decisions.* Every choice they make triggers different outcomes, allowing them to experience the impact of their actions. Through these *dynamic scenarios*, players learn essential life-saving techniques and strategies in a *safe, engaging environment*, contributing to better public safety awareness.

**Danger Dash** was inspired by the *younger siblings, cousins, and children* in our lives who often find themselves unknowingly close to danger. In a world where *everyday risks* are ever-present, we wanted to create a tool that not only teaches safety but does so in a way that’s fun and educational. By creating this game, we hope to provide children—and even adults—with the *skills to navigate emergencies* and the awareness they need to stay safe.

The next step for **Danger Dash** is to expand gameplay by adding a *points system* and *in-game gear* that players can collect and use during emergencies. This will encourage players to be *resourceful* and think strategically in high-pressure situations. We also plan to introduce *new emergency scenarios* and possibly even a *multiplayer mode*, where players can collaborate to tackle *complex situations* together, making the experience even more immersive and educational.
